# File Automator
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSmpFOx0i0
#### Description:
My final CS50P project is a file automation app that distributes the files you download to the corresponding folders, based on pre-set settings and the tags you select for them. You can choose one main (or stem) tag/directory and more than one sub tag/directory.
<br><br>
Before you start using the app, please create a file, called dirs.py and structure it as per the dir_example.txt file, provided in the repository. Then fill in the following data:
1. Your source directory (in most cases, that's the Downloads folder)
2. Your base target directory (for instance, a folder with your name where you store all of your files or just the Documents/Desktop folder)
3. Your main directories - these are the folders you use most frequently. Instances of such directories are high school folders, university, work, etc.
4. You sub directories - you can go as deep as you would like to here. Feel free to list all of the sub directories you use while browsing the web and downloading new files.
<br>
Once you are done with the setup, start the app by executing ./file_automator.py in the terminal of your IDE.
<br><br>
To run the unit tests, execute the command pytest test_file_automator.py.
